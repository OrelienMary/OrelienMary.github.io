						Rubika is an incredible place to meet profesional of the industry, exchange and learn from them. I have been learning about the theory of Game Design, but we have also lots of opportunities to put it to practice, with short projects, intensive weeks or lasting several months.
						<br/>
						If i had to recall some of the lessons I learned during my time here:
						<ul class="default">
							<li>Don't be afraid to not use an idea for this game, it is not lost you can keep it in mind for another project.</li>
							<li>Communication is primordial as a Game Designer, and it is at least half of our work to communicate our ideas smoothly to the rest of the team.</li>
							<li>It is important to know about every components that are part of a video game, graphics, sound, programmation, writing, game mechanics, because they all can be used to create impactful experiences.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>	My first internship! It was in a small company making VR experiences. It's a welcoming team of 7 people.
							<br/>
							I mainly worked on the pre-production of the next game they were going to produce, with the help of the manager. It's a racing party game, like Mario Kart, but in VR. 
							<br/>
							<br/>
							So my tasks were to:
						
						<ul class="default">
							<li>Conceptualize and formatize every aspects of the game.</li>
							<li>Create Level Designs that would serve for their first prototype.</li>
							<li>Presentate the concept and ideas to the rest of the team.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							But most importantly I learned:							
						</p>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>To communicate more efficaciously.</li>
							<li>To work with a waterfall hierarchy.</li>
							<li>To create experiences with the limits of a platform like VR.</li>
						</ul>

							<h3>Golden Rails</h3>
							<p>Boardgame</p>
						</header>
						
						<p>	This is my first long-length project, we created the boardgame in 8 months. We were a team of 6 persons. 
						The production was different than with a video game. We were able to have a prototype very fast, and we could test mechanics quasi instantly.
						<br/>
						It was a very good experience to start testing Game Design ideas. 
						<br/>
						About the game itself, it's a goold-old western setting, you robber a train with the help of other criminals, but you all want more money than the others. It's a coopetition game where you help but also betray your friends.
							<br/>
							<br/>
							What I did on the project:
						
						<ul class="default">
							<li>Working on the concept with a bottom-up method, coming from the mechanics, to the universe.</li>
							<li>Keep the documentation up-to-date with clear documents.</li>
							<li>Create prototypes, playtest again and again, and balancing a lot.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							But most importantly I learned:							
						</p>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>To work with a team and overcome discord with calm and logic, to take a decision.</li>
							<li>That you can create fun, with simple but good systems.</li>
							<li>That the more you polish and test, the better the final experience will be.</li>
						</ul>

							<h3>Kairos' Heritage</h3>
							<p>Escape Game</p>
						</header>
						
						<p>
						This was a project done during an intensive week, like a week-long jam. It was quite chalenging, we were 6 in the team, and we had to create from scratch an escape game playable at the end of the week.
						I was Project Manager on the project, and it is one of the most satisfying project I worked on. We were all pride of the product we delivered in the end, and we did everything that we planned.
						Moreover seeing people enjoying our escape game at the end was very fulfilling.
						
							<br/>
							<br/>
							What I did on the project:
						
						<ul class="default">
							<li>As Project Manager, I had to do wroten report everyday about how the production was going on, and if the work produced by the team was enough.</li>
							<li>I animated the reunions with the team, and distributed the tasks.</li>
							<li>And of course, puzzles and design for the Escape Game itself.</li>

							<h3>Golem</h3>
							<p>Roguelike</p>
						</header>
						
						<p>
						This game has been done in 4 months with a team of 6 persons. It was the first time I programmed a video game entirely, and it allowed me to discover the afinity I had with programmation, but also that I didn't want to work exclusively in this field.
						<br/>
						Rogue like is a type of game I particularly enjoy, and that I find interesting for its replay value, so I was very excited to work on this project. The concept revolves around time, and I'm pretty proud of it and more particularly of the system around it.
						<br/>
						But the production of the game has been pretty arsh. For a first video game it was hard to be Project Manager, Lead Game Designer and learn how to code. So the final result is still what we were planning, but the game doesn't seem finished. 
						This project still left me a little bitter, evenmore for a type of game I enjoy this much. But well, it is also probably the project that made me learn the more. So I'll use all this knowledge for good next time!
						
							<br/>
							<br/>
							What I did on the project:
						
						<ul class="default">
							<li>Creating game mechanics and systems that would keep the player engage for an hour of play.</li>
							<li>Balancing of the random in the genration of rooms, or in the drops of ennemies.</li>
							<li>All the programmation, player mechanics, ennemies AI, game system.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							But most importantly I learned:							
						</p>
						<ul class="default">
							<li>Accesibility and feedbacks are capital, or the player won't stay engaged.</li>
							<li>Randomness is a incredible tool of Game Design, with it you can simulate life or create fun with good probabilities.</li>
							<li>Always plan the code, I have taken an habit of writing it on a panel beforehand.</li>
						</ul>

							<h3>Golem Invocator</h3>
							<p>Autobattler</p>
						</header>
						
						<p>
						The history of this game is kinda funny, because I created it with another person before hearing about Autobattlers. And it's only when testing one latter that I realized it was completely falling in its definition. 
						But to make it simple, the principle is two invocators creating chess-like pieces, which must go to the other side of the board. The pieces move automatically, so the only decision is where and when to create it.
						It was very fun to create this game, evenmore since I am a fan of chess.

							<h3>Tetrabot</h3>
							<p>Jam Video Game</p>
						</header>
						
						<p>
						The game was created during a game jam, so in only 2 days. I was with a team of 6 peoples, who were mostly friends. Creating during jam is always a good experience, for the ambiance and the emulation it creates, and with friends it was even better. 
						This is one of the projects that permited to realize that after spending 4 months learning to code on a big project, we could now create some decent prototypes in only 2 days.

							<h3>Monarchy</h3>
							<p>Card Game</p>
						</header>
						
						<p>
						This game was conceptualize and prototype very quickly, I was alone creating it. I wanted to try myself at creating a card game. I didn't want it to be a collectible one, I wanted something simple and elegant, and indeed there is only 5 cards needed for this game. 
						I playtested it a lot with friends, and still from time to time we play it. It was a good experience and satisfying of creating a deep system with only 5 cards. And this game also represent my passion for card games and mind games.
